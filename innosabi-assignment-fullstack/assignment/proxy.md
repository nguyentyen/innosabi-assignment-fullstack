# Developer challenge - Proxy## Getting all the projectsWe want to provide a simple and small Web-Toolkit for our clients, so they can quickly create own widgets for their corporate homepage or mobile apps. Part of the toolkit should be a proxy for an API user connection.### ChallengeSince the credentials shouldn't be stored in the third party frontend, you should create a small proxy that will log in as an API user and fetch all the public projects from our API. A third party application should then be able to request a JSON object including the needed attributes of the projects via an include parameters.### Example call and responseRequest: ``[yourApplication]/innosabi-projects?include=name,description,startDate``Response: ``[{"name":"Solution Scouting","description":"Help us solve challenges in our development and production.","startDate":"2016-06-16 14:12:28.000000"}, ... ]``### EnvironmentStaging: https://demo.staging.innosabi.com/api/v2/project/filterProduction: https://demo.innosabi.com/api/v2/project/filter### Project APIOur old API v2 provides the current projects of the authenticated in user at:https://demo.[staging.]innosabi.com/api/v2/project/filter### AuthenticationSimple BASIC_AUTH can be used to fetch any data for given user from our API.### API credentials``Username: api@innosabi.comPassword: 0thRuch0``### Frameworks/PluginsYou are free to use any PHP framework or composer plugins etc. You can use this project or start from scratch.
